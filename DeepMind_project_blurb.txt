Our collaborators needed millions of two-electron integrals to be calculated for a quantum chemical methodology using 200-digit precision and I calculated their implementation would take several months to complete. I wrote a highly optimized, vectorized and parallelized C program which used ball arithmetic to calculate all required integrals with error bounds in several hours. They primarily used Python so I compiled the program into a shared object library which could be directly called from their Python programs.
