%I have developed and implemented numerous computer programs throughout my academic career including calculation of the current best electron correlation energies and wavefunctions for two-electron systems, deep learning inspired GPU eigenvalue solvers, quantum chemical methodologies, large ill-conditioned matrix eigenvalue solvers, non-linear parameter optimisers, numerous quantum chemical methodologies, numerical integration, massively parallel two-electron integral calculations and many more; all using parallel and GPU programming techniques where beneficial. I have specialised knowledge in greater than double precision calculations, using techniques including DoubleDouble/QuadDouble data types and ball arithmetic. 

%My current goal is to build upon my scientific training by broadening my understanding of applied machine and deep learning to problems in the natural sciences. A position at DeepMind offers the perfect opportunity to utilize and improve my skills as a scientist and developer.
