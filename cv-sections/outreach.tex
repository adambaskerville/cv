\cvparagraph{I collaborated with colleagues with funding from EPSRC to design an interactive game for public engagement events called ``Quantum Leap'', which explains quantised energy levels in quantum mechanics to all ages. This was met with positive feedback at various events including Widening Participation (WP) and Wonderfest.

From April to July 2020 I took part in ``Iâ€™m a Scientist, Stay at Home'', which is an online public engagement resource connecting school students from years 5/P5 to year 13/S6 directly with research scientists to ask questions. I was named in the top 10 most engaged scientists out of over 100 that participated; where schools and the general public asked questions related to my research and science in general.

I also run a blog called Textbook to Terminal, T>T, (\url{https://adambaskerville.github.io}) which discusses how to program interesting science and mathematical related problems along with useful tools and ideas for researchers.}
